<p>Have you ever wanted to be able write Java in Welsh? No? Neither have I. However, with half an hour spare, I thought it'd be a fun (yet relatively pointless) little project to help learn the basics of Perl.</p>

<p><span class="code">llavac</span> is a Perl script acting as a simple wrapper for the command-line Java compiler (<span class="code">javac</span>). It works by carrying out basic string replacements on a currently incomplete set of Welsh Java keywords in order to create a temporary 'English' Java source file, which is then compiled and deleted.</p>

<p>Below is a simple "helo!" Java program written in Welsh.</p>

<pre class="java">
cyhoedd dosbarth Example{ 
    cyhoedd sefydlog ddi-rym main(String[] args){ 
        System.out.println("helo!"); 
    } 
} 
</pre>

<p>Use <span class="code">llavac</span> in place of directly running <span class="code">javac</span> to compile it, before running it as a normal Java program. Compiler errors will still be shown in English, however!</p>

<pre class="shell">
$ ./llavac.pl Example.java
$ java Example
</pre>

<p>The script is available from <a href="https://github.com/flyingsparx/llavac" target="_blank">this repository</a>.</p>
