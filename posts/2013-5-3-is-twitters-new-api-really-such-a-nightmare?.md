title: Is Twitter's New API Really Such a Nightmare?
---

<p>When the first version of the Twitter API opened, writing applications to interface with the popular microblogging service was a dream. Developers could quickly set up apps and access the many resources provided by the API and third parties were fast in creating easy-to-use wrappers and interfaces (in loads of different languages) for embedding Twitter functionality in all sorts of applications and services.</p>
<p>The API began by using Basic Authentication, at least for making the requests that required authentication (e.g. writing Tweets, following users, etc.). This is, generally, a Very Bad Idea, since it meant that client applications were required to handle the users' usernames and passwords and transmit these, along with any extra required parameters, in every request made to the API. Users had no idea (and no control over) what the organisations behind these applications did with the access credentials once they were provided with them.</p>
<p>Then, in 2010, the API moved on to OAuth. This was a much better authentication protocol, as it meant that users could directly authorise apps from Twitter itself and easily view which functions each individual app would be able to perform with their Twitter account. In addition, it meant that applications didn't need to receive and/or store the user's username and password; instead, an access token would be sent back to the app (after authentication), which would then be used to make the requests to the API. This access token could then be sent, along with the application's own key and secret key, with requests to the API, which would be able to recognise the authenticating user based on the access token and restrict/allow actions based on who the user is. Since apps could safely store the user's access key without too many security implications, it meant that the procedure was much more personalised and streamlined for the end-users.</p>
<p>What was cool was that there were still several methods exposed by Twitter's API that <i>didn't</i> require authentication. Things like retrieving a user's recent Tweets or the public timeline involved a simple JSON request that could easily be made from a client without authenticating first. This was particularly useful when used with JavaScript as clients could still request the information and, due to the distributed nature of clients (i.e. not making requests from a single IP or application signature), they wouldn't generally reach the rate limit for these methods.</p>

<p>It meant that you could embed a Twitter feed showing your recent Tweets on your website without having to hop through your own servers first.</p>
<p>Now Twitter have opened v1.1 of their API, with all methods from the previous version becoming deprecated and should expect complete removal some time in 2013.  The main disadvantage with version 1.1 is that now <strong>all</strong> requests to the API will require OAuth authentication. This means that client-side JavaScript Twitter requests will no longer be safely available (as clients would have access to the application's private key, amongst other things), and developers will be forced to use Twitter's own massive and unstylable <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-timelines" target="_blank">widgets</a>. Twitter themselves also (sensibly, I suppose) discourage users from trying to write their own client-side code for this.</p>
<p>Of course, you could modify your app so that your server makes the requests, authenticated with your own account, and then passes the response to the browser, but if your site is fairly popular and caching requests isn't appropriate for your purposes then you are at risk of running into rate limit issues. This leads me to another (slightly less important) disadvantage. Whilst the API used to grant each authenticated application 350 requests per hour, the rate limit system has now become unnecessarily complicated, with many methods having completely different request allowances per window (which has now been reduced to 15 minutes). On top of this, many resources actually have <strong>two</strong> rate limits - one for that particular user, and one for the app itself. They also have a <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/rate-limiting/1.1/limits" target="_blank">handy table</a> outlining the rate limits of each method. It's starting to become a bit more of a mess for developers, with many more things to think about.</p>

<br />
<p>Despite all the additional strictness with the API, there are actually several advantages. Requests that are user-focused (i.e. have a separate user-based rate limit) mean that your application, if used correctly, may be able to access more information before reaching the limits. This is also true of some of the application-based resources, such as "GET search/tweets" and "GET statuses/user_timeline", which now allow many more requests to be made in the same time frame than in API v1.</p>
<p>For other methods, though, it's not so great. Most of the user-based rate-limited methods allow 15 requests per window (equating to one request per minute). For me, and others who research Twitter, who require a fair amount of data, this will become a nightmare. There are also many app developers who are being impacted pretty heavily by the new changes, which includes Twitter's (slightly evil) new policy to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/16/3248079/twitter-limits-app-developers-control" target="_blank">restrict apps to 100,000 users</a>.</p>
<br />
<p>Generally, there is a different set of advantages and disadvantages every way you look at it, but with the web's turn to the ubiquitous availability and propagation of information, and some other open and awesome APIs (including <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com" target="_blank">Foursquare's</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/api" target="_blank" >Last.fm's</a>), then it's hard to know in which direction Twitter is heading at the moment.</p>
